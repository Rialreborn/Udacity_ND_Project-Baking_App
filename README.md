# Udacity Project - Baking App


## Project Overview
Android Project for [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) 

This projects aim is to build an app to view video recipes.

You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## Why this Project
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.
